Ayre is a Visual Question Answering project created by members of [this organization](https://github.com/projectayre) as part of our semester V projects and coursework during our Bachelor's degree. This is primarily a research based project, since Visual Question Answering with Sentiment Analysis is a significant research gap that we would like to address.
